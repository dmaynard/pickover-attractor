# Pickover Attractor

A Rust application using [macroquad](https://github.com/not-fl3/macroquad) to visualize Pickover attractors with multiple color channels, real-time parameter generation, interactive controls, and beautiful symmetry patterns. **Runs on both desktop and web browsers using WebAssembly!**

üåê **Live Demo**: [https://dmaynard.github.io/pickover-attractor](https://dmaynard.github.io/pickover-attractor)

## Features

- **Multiple Color Modes**: RGB (independent channels), Monochrome (grayscale), and Correlated (related channels)
- **Day/Night Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes with proper visual clearing
- **Symmetry Patterns**: 4-fold, 6-fold, and 8-fold radial symmetry for stunning geometric patterns
- **Real-time Parameter Generation**: Automatically generates interesting attractor parameters
- **Interactive Controls**: UI for switching color modes, symmetry, and adjusting correlated deviation
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time FPS and performance metrics
- **Window Resizing**: Handles dynamic window resizing
- **Automatic Reset**: Resets when attractors become saturated or stagnant
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs natively on desktop and in web browsers via WebAssembly

## Controls

### Keyboard Controls
- **Space**: Generate new attractor parameters
- **I**: Toggle day/night mode (invert colors)
- **M**: Cycle through color modes (RGB ‚Üí Monochrome ‚Üí Correlated)
- **S**: Cycle through symmetry modes (None ‚Üí 4-fold ‚Üí 6-fold ‚Üí 8-fold)
- **R**: Toggle red channel on/off (RGB mode only)
- **G**: Toggle green channel on/off (RGB mode only)
- **B**: Toggle blue channel on/off (RGB mode only)
- **Slash (/)**: Toggle help display
- **Q**: Quit the application (desktop only)

### Mouse Controls
- **Left Click**: Click UI buttons for color mode, symmetry, day/night toggle, and next attractor
- **Drag**: Adjust the correlated deviation slider (in correlated mode)

## Color Modes

### RGB Mode
- Each color channel (Red, Green, Blue) operates independently
- Each channel has its own attractor parameters
- Individual channels can be toggled on/off with R, G, B keys
- Creates colorful, dynamic visualizations

### Monochrome Mode
- Only the red channel is active
- Creates grayscale visualizations
- Useful for studying the mathematical structure

### Correlated Mode
- All channels share base parameters with small deviations
- Adjustable deviation percentage (0-5%)
- Creates harmonious, related color patterns

## Symmetry Modes

### No Symmetry
- Shows the natural, organic form of the attractor
- Best for studying the base mathematical behavior

### 4-Fold Radial Symmetry
- Creates 90-degree rotational patterns
- Produces geometric, mandala-like designs

### 6-Fold Radial Symmetry
- Creates 60-degree rotational patterns
- Generates snowflake-like crystalline structures

### 8-Fold Radial Symmetry
- Creates 45-degree rotational patterns
- Produces complex, kaleidoscopic patterns

## Day/Night Mode

- **Day Mode**: Black background with bright attractor colors
- **Night Mode**: White background with dark attractor colors
- Seamlessly switches between modes without visual artifacts
- All new attractors inherit the current mode setting

## Technical Details

The application implements the Pickover attractor equations:
- `x' = sin(b*y) - c*sin(b*x)`
- `y' = sin(a*x) + d*cos(a*y)`

Where a, b, c, and d are parameters that determine the attractor's behavior.

The symmetry calculations use high-precision floating-point arithmetic to ensure smooth, artifact-free patterns.

## Building and Running

### Desktop Version

#### Prerequisites
- Rust and Cargo installed on your system

#### Build
```bash
cargo build
```

#### Run
```bash
cargo run
```

#### Release Build
```bash
cargo build --release
cargo run --release
```

### Web Version (WebAssembly)

#### Prerequisites
- Rust and Cargo installed on your system
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)

#### Build and Test Locally

**Step 1: Build the WASM version**
```bash
# Make the build script executable (first time only)
chmod +x build_macroquad_wasm.sh

# Build the WebAssembly version
./build_macroquad_wasm.sh
```

**Step 2: Start a local web server**

*Option A: Using basic-http-server (recommended)*
```bash
# The build script should install this automatically
basic-http-server .
# Then open http://localhost:4000 in your browser
```

*Option B: Using Python (if you have Python 3 installed)*
```bash
python3 -m http.server 4000
# Then open http://localhost:4000 in your browser
```

*Option C: Using Node.js (if you have Node.js installed)*
```bash
npx http-server . -p 4000
# Then open http://localhost:4000 in your browser
```

**Step 3: Test in your browser**
- Open your web browser
- Navigate to `http://localhost:4000`
- You should see the Pickover Attractor running in your browser!
- Try the keyboard controls: Space (new attractor), I (day/night), M (color modes), S (symmetry)

#### Troubleshooting
- **Port 4000 already in use**: Try a different port (e.g., `basic-http-server . --port 4001`)
- **Build fails**: Make sure you have the latest Rust toolchain (`rustup update`)
- **WASM doesn't load**: Check browser console for errors and ensure you're using a modern browser
- **Performance issues**: Close other browser tabs and ensure hardware acceleration is enabled

## Performance

The application is optimized for real-time visualization:
- Efficient pixel buffer management
- Change tracking to minimize texture updates
- Automatic performance monitoring and logging
- **WebAssembly provides near-native performance in browsers**
